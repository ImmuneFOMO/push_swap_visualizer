# push_swap_visualizer
This python script was created to visualize your work with the PUSH_SWAP
42 Project.

You must put this script in the same path of your program
Of course you need Python3 with the Tkinter UI.

You can install it with Brew.

--> Brew install python3

Execute the script with : 

--> python3 pyvis.py `ruby -e "puts (-200..200).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')"` 

You can change the PUSHS_PATH to get to the relative path of your push_swap
You can pause, decrease or increase the speed, or reset as will.
